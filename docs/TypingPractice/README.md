<h1>TypingPractice</h1>

<p>TypingPractice is an online browser-based typing test developed by <a href="https://github.com/FrumentumMC">FrumentumMC on GitHub</a> using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. It was first launched on December 8, 2022 using <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a> which makes it open source. TypingPractice is a practical test that measures your typing speed and accuracy based on your performance.</p>

<p>The typing speed measures your WPM or words per minute for each 1-minute round you play. The WPM is calculated by the number of correct entries divided by 5, which is considered to be the average word length in the English language. The number of "words" is then divided by the total elapsed time in minutes. The average WPM is said to be around 40.</p>

<strong>
Example:<br>
Total Keys Pressed = 200<br>
Time Elapsed in Minutes = 1<br>
WPM = (200 / 5) / 1 = 40
</strong>

<hr>

<p>Typing accuracy is defined as the percentage of correct entries out of the total entries typed. We calculate this by dividing the number of correct keys pressed by the total number of keys pressed and multiplying by 100.</p>

<strong>
Example:<br>
Total Keys Pressed = 200<br>
Correct Keys Pressed = 190<br>
Accuracy = (190 / 200) * 100 = 95%
</strong>

<hr>

<p>Typing score, or adjusted words per minute is your speed (WPM score) adjusted for the number of errors made during the lesson or activity. This is done by multiplying the WPM score and accuracy percentage. This data point is a single number that takes into account both speed and accuracy.</p>

<strong>
Example:<br>
WPM = 40<br>
Accuracy = 95%<br>
AWPM (Score) = 40 * 0.95 = 38
</strong>

<h2>How to play</h2>

<p>Simply start by typing in the sentences you see above in the text box. Once you start typing, you only have 1 minute to type as many correct characters as you can. If all the characters in a string of text are correct, you would have to type in a new string of text until the timer has counted down to 0.</p>
